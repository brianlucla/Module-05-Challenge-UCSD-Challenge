# Daily Work Schedule Calendar 

## Description

This project allows users to input events into a 24hr planner and save them. Past, present, and future events are all color coded for clarity. We were motivated to build this project to help users plan out their day easily and accessibly. This project helped me learn how to use jQuery as well as dayjs. 

## Installation

N/a

## Usage

Enter an event into a row in the planner. Press the save button, and the event will be saved to local storage.
