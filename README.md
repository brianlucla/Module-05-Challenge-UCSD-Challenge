# Daily Work Schedule Calendar 

## Description

This project allows users to input events into a 24hr planner and save them. Past, present, and future events are all color coded for clarity. We were motivated to build this project to help users plan out their day easily and accessibly. This project helped me learn how to use jQuery as well as dayjs. 

## Installation

N/a

## Usage



Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
